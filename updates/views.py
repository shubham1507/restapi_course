        Django uses request and response objects to pass state through the system. Each view is responsible for returning an HttpResponse object. Using HttpResponse you need to first serialize your object to JSON.

Whereas,

Since version 1.7, Django counts with the built-in JsonResponse class, which is a subclass of HttpResponse. Its default Content-Type header is set to application/json, which is really convenient. It also comes with a JSON encoder, so you donâ€™t need to serialize the data before returning the response object.
